   a hash to first organize the records by a key.`,

   Seq Scans (unlike Index Scans) perform a single read operation (only the table is read).`,

   read the index and another to read the actual value from the table.`,

   from the index and do not read from the corresponding table.`,

   Results of this node are fed to the <strong>Bitmap Heap Scan</strong>.`,
   'CTE SCAN': `performs a sequential scan of <strong>Common Table Expression (CTE) query</strong> results. Note that
   results of a CTE are materialized (calculated and temporarily stored).`
